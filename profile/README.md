### 1. Organization Overview
Oinone, an enterprise-grade productization engine under Shushi Tech, is a unified low-code platform empowering enterprises to drive standardized R&D and agile delivery. Focused on addressing the productization transformation needs of software companies, it resolves the long-standing industry dilemma of fragmented standardized product development and customized delivery through its integrated "Standardized R&D + Agile Delivery" architecture. 

The "O" symbolizes open source while phonetically resonating with "All in one," symbolizing:
 - One-stop solutions
 - Agile responsiveness
 - Continuous innovation

We are committed to building an open low-code/no-code ecosystem that creates value for clients while empowering developers. Through our "co-creation" philosophy, we aim to aggregate collective wisdom and resources, fostering innovation and development for Chinese developers to help every idea flourish within our ecosystem.

#### Mission：_To establish the foundational technology platform for intelligence software products, driving industry transformation, empowering partners, and creating customer value._

### 5、Platform Value
#### 5.1 Enhances R&D Efficiency
##### 5.1.1 Why Traditional Software Development Is Inefficient?
![Traditional](http://oinone-jar.oss-cn-zhangjiakou.aliyuncs.com/welcome-document/Open%20Source/en/5.1.Traditional%20R%26D.png "Traditional")
- Redundant coding efforts across frontend and backend
- Time-consuming cross-team coordination for integration
- Recurring basic bugs requiring repeated testing iterations
- Inconsistent coding standards

Vicious cycle triggered by requirement changes and repeating these processes leads to:
- Compromised development quality
- Project timeline overruns
- Excessive overtime workloads
- Self-perpetuating inefficiency loops

##### 5.1.2 How Oinone Drives Significant Efficiency Gains
![Oinone](http://oinone-jar.oss-cn-zhangjiakou.aliyuncs.com/welcome-document/Open%20Source/en/5.2.Oinone%20R%26D.png "Oinone")
- 40%-300% efficiency improvement across full development lifecycle
- Continuous accumulation of reusable frontend components and industry-specific backend models
- Talent optimization that mid-level developers deliver senior-level output and senior developers focus on industry capability

##### 5.1.3 Efficiency Benchmark Overview

#### 5.2 Productization Enablement
##### 5.2.1 Current Challenges in Software Productization
###### Challenge 1: The Standard Product Delivery Paradox
![reusable](http://oinone-jar.oss-cn-zhangjiakou.aliyuncs.com/welcome-document/Open%20Source/en/5.4.The%20Standard%20Product%20Delivery%20Paradox.png "reusable")
-  **Assumption:**  60% reusable components with isolated 40% customization
-  **Actual:**  60% average reusability requiring universal adjustments + dependency management

Root causes:
- Hyper-customization requirements per every client
- Misjudged reusability metrics that "60%" represents feature-level average(not holistic applicability), customizations create irregular complexity distribution and market-driven erosion: 60% → 30% annual reusability decline.

###### Challenge 2: Flawed Delivery Models
![Delivery models](http://oinone-jar.oss-cn-zhangjiakou.aliyuncs.com/welcome-document/Open%20Source/en/5.5.Flawed%20Delivery%20Models.png "Delivery models")
Two problematic approaches:
- Branch Copy Delivery: Upgrade bottlenecks, maintenance complexity, knowledge silo formation
- Unified Product Delivery: Endless customization conflicts, implementation team backlog accumulation

##### 5.2.2 Oinone's Productization Architecture
